## How to reproduce results
0. [Optional] Set the paths in the configs. But the default paths should work as well.
  - Set path where to store prerendered dataset in [src/1st_level/config.py](src/1st_level/config.py)
  - Set path where the predicts of the 1st level models are saved in [src/2nd_level/config.py](src/2nd_level/config.py)

1. Install dependencies. 
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Apply patch to l5kit with `./apply_l5kit_patch.sh` (it disables processing of rasterized images to allow rasterizer to return multiple results).

2. Download and prepare data.
```
bash prepare_data_train.sh
```
3. Train 1st level models.
```
bash train.sh
```
4. Run inference of 1st level models on the test set.  
You may need to change which chekpoints to load when predicting (in [predict_test_l1.sh](predict_test_l1.sh)), as the best epoch may change after you retrain the models.
```
bash prepare_data_test.sh
bash predict_test_l1.sh
```
4. Train 2nd level model on the predicts of the 1st level models on the test set.
```
cd src/2nd_level && python train.py
```
Make sure you've set all paths right in `2nd_level/config.py` w.r.t. the `2nd_level` directory.

6. Predict on the test set using the 2nd level model.
```
cd src/2nd_level && python infer.py
```

The file witn final predictions will be saved to `src/2nd_level/submission.csv'.  

Directory structure example (i.e., how it should look like after everything is trained and predicted) is in [directory_structure.txt](directory_structure.txt).


## Extra
- To skip training the 1st level models, you can download the pretrained weights by running `bash download_1st_level_weights.sh`.
- To skip training and inference of the 1st level models, you can download all predicts. More details on this are in [src/1st_level/submissions](src/1st_level/submissions).
- More details on how to use 2nd level model are in [src/2nd_level](src/2nd_level).
- Our final 2nd level model with *9.404 Private LB score* is already committed in this repository ([src/2nd_level/transformer.bin](src/2nd_level/transformer.bin)). To run inference using this model you can directly execute `cd src/2nd_level && python infer.py`.
